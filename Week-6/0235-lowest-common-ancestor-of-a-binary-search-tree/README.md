# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow  **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -109 <= Node.val <= 109
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the BST.

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        int small = Math.min(p.val, q.val);
        int large = Math.max(p.val, q.val);
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > large) // p, q belong to the left subtree
                root = root.left;
            else if (root.val < small) // p, q belong to the right subtree
                root = root.right;
            else // Now, small <= root.val <= large -> This root is the LCA between p and q
                return root;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
